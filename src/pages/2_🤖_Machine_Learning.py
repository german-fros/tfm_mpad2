MACHINE LEARNING PAGE - PLAYER CLUSTERING AND PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS

This page implements machine learning models for analyzing Inter Miami player data,
focusing on clustering analysis to identify player roles and playing styles.

PURPOSE:
- Cluster players based on performance metrics and playing style
- Identify player roles and tactical profiles
- Predict player performance and potential
- Provide insights for tactical analysis and team composition

FUTURE ML IMPLEMENTATIONS:
1. Player Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN)
2. Performance Prediction Models
3. Playing Style Classification
4. Tactical Formation Analysis
5. Player Similarity Analysis

CLUSTERING FEATURES TO USE:
- Positional data (x, y coordinates, zones)
- Performance metrics (goals, assists, passes, defensive actions)
- Playing style indicators (pass length, forward passes, risk-taking)
- Physical metrics (distance covered, sprint counts)

VISUALIZATIONS:
- 2D/3D cluster visualization using PCA or t-SNE
- Cluster characteristics radar charts
- Player similarity networks
- Feature importance plots
- Model performance metrics
- Interactive cluster exploration

ML PIPELINE SECTIONS:
1. Feature Engineering and Selection
2. Data Preprocessing and Scaling
3. Model Training and Validation
4. Cluster Analysis and Interpretation
5. Model Results and Insights

INTERACTIVE FEATURES:
- Feature selection for clustering
- Number of clusters selection (k-means)
- Algorithm parameter tuning
- Cluster assignment exploration
- Player search within clusters
- Export model results and visualizations

DATA PREPROCESSING:
- Handle missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Outlier detection and treatment

MODEL EVALUATION:
- Silhouette score
- Elbow method for optimal k
- Cluster stability analysis
- Cross-validation metrics

DEPENDENCIES:
- streamlit for UI
- scikit-learn for ML algorithms
- plotly for interactive visualizations
- pandas/numpy for data manipulation
- utils.data_loader for data access
- utils.visualization_utils for ML visualizations
